# GioMhail
Stuy APCS1 Final Project, Mikhail Kotlik &amp; Giovanni Topa

## Description
GioMhail by Coolgle, is a barebones, console email client.
Like a simpler Mozilla Thunderbird, it allows users to securely view and send emails through any email service.

## Running
Open your favorite console and type: java Client. It's that simple!
(Assuming you've installed the latest JVM, downloaded the repo, and navigated to the folder.)
(If using source code, type javac *.java to compile all Java files in the source code folder, then run.)

## Instructions
Just follow the client's instructions! Helpful in-app prompts and command lists will guide you as you use it.
It's that simple!
