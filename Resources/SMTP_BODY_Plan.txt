- [DONE] Add BODY menu, which after every enter takes a userInput line and adds it to a local variables ArrayList<String>
     of the main method. There should also be an int var linePos that signifies which index of
     the ArrayList is currently getting filled. Every time BODY is looped, where the screen says Body:,
     there should be a for loop that prints out all the lines that are in the ArrayList.  There should be a carrot '>'
     on the screen directly below the last line printed, corresponding to the line currently being filled,
     and to the linePos. The prompt should stay as it was, except that commands sohuld be prefixed with $,
     to distinguish them from regular text (as in $back, $exit). There should be a new command, $delPrev, which deletes
     the previous line form the ArrayList (thus it should also not be printed to screen on next iteration), and lowers
     the linePos var. This allows the user to retype a bad line if they already entered it.
     Note, there is no way to edit text like in a text editor with java (using arrow keys to go between lines), so we
     have to make do with this cmd.
